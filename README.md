# SA-Heat-OpenFOAM-v11
Modeling heat transfer in canonical wall-bounded flows over a wide range of Prandtl numbers with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model

Source code and case templates are given for Pr=1 cases. To change the Prandtl number it is sufficient to edit the value of "Pr" in the "constant/turbulenceProperties" file of the case.
